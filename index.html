        <p class="content-section">My name is marco Rodriguez, born and raised in San Antonio TX.
            I have always been a competitive and driven person with web development being my latest 
            grind. Growing up I was very much a family guy nothing was better then kicking it with
            loved ones. other then that I was heavily involved with every soprt i could get into with football 
            being my favorite. Sometime late in highschool when i got my first computer my passion
            for sports turn into a passion for gaming. I quickly became obsessed with a game called smite 
            and raced up the ranked latter. During that time I would save money for whatever computer upgrades
            i could afford and i realized i wanted to be around this technology for my career. Unsure of what 
            field in the IT world i wanted to head in i decided to take a year break to go work at Walt Disney
            world with my girldfriend. After covid and the park shutting down i came home to get on the road to
            becoming the career man i always wanted. So here i am now a freshman in the feild eager to learn 
            and earn my stripes.
